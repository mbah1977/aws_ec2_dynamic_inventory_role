# The entire code, including the Python script located in the templates directory, has been written with the assumption that Ansible has already been installed on the control node,
# that the AWS CLI has been set up to enable your Ansible control node to talk to your AWS account by CLI.
# and that you have the AWS private key pair to be used by your Ansible_remoet_user to connect to EC2 instances via SSH.
# Variables are in the vars/main.yml file for any overwriting.
